# liblod-php

A Linked Open Data library for PHP, developed as part of the
[RES project](http://res.space/).

**Note that this is experimental code which is still under development.**

## Requirements

PHP 5.6 or higher (it works under PHP 7, but no features from PHP 7 are used).

## Installation

To install this library for use with your own code, do:

```
composer require res/liblod
```

???TODO

## Usage

See `liblod-php_usage.md` (in this directory).

## Developing the code

To develop liblod-php, you'll need to install the dependencies. You can do this
with:

```
php tools/composer.phar install
```

## Running the tests

To run the unit tests:

```
./vendor/bin/robo unit
```

To run the integration tests:

```
./vendor/bin/robo int
```

**Note that the integration tests work against the live [Acropolis stack](http://acropolis.org.uk/) and other LOD sites, so you will need a network connection to run them. They can also be somewhat fragile, as the number of statements for Acropolis resources may periodically change, depending on what has been ingested. This can occasionally cause test failures.**

## Code coverage

To generate a code coverage report for the tests, you will first need to [install the XDebug PHP module](https://xdebug.org/docs/install). Then, run:

```
./vendor/bin/robo cov
```

The report can be viewed by opening `build/cov/index.html` in a web browser.

## Code quality

Code quality checks can be run with:

```
./vendor/bin/robo mess
```

This uses [PHPMD](https://phpmd.org/) to report on various issues with the code.

## API docs

Rudimentary (incomplete) API docs can be generated with:

```
./vendor/bin/robo docs
```

The generated docs end up in the `build/apidocs/` directory.

## Code style checking

The code style can be checked with:

```
./vendor/bin/robo style
```

The code style report ends up in the `build/style/` directory.

(Note that the code style configuration is in the `phpcheckstyle-config.xml` file.)

## Authors

API design by [Mo McRoberts](https://github.com/nevali).

Implementation by [Elliot Smith](https://github.com/townxelliot).
