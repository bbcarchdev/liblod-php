# res/liblod

A Linked Open Data library for PHP, developed as part of the
[RES project](http://res.space/).

**Note that this is experimental code which is still under development.**

## Requirements

PHP 5 (may work under PHP 7, but no features from PHP 7 are used).

## Installation

```
composer require res/liblod
```

## Usage

See `res_liblod_usage.md` (in this directory).

## Developing the code

To develop res/liblod, you'll need to install the dependencies. You can do this
with:

```
php tools/composer.phar install
```

## Running the tests

To run the unit tests:

```
php tools/phpunit.phar --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests/unit
```

To run the integration tests:

```
php tools/phpunit.phar --bootstrap vendor/autoload.php tests/integration
```

**Note that the integration tests work against the live [Acropolis stack](http://acropolis.org.uk/) and other LOD sites, so you will need a network connection to run them. They can also be somewhat fragile, as the number of statements for Acropolis resources may periodically change, depending on what's being ingested.**
